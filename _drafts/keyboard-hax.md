There are maybe five creations I have wanted to build since I can remember. My "forever projects". 
I want to build a full CPU out of [7400 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series) logic chips with brainfuck as its' ISA. 
I want to build a complete mechanical replica of an enigma machine. 
I want a typewriter that can type by itself, I want to make a [piet](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html) interpreter in piet, and I want to make my own [sci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sierra%27s_Creative_Interpreter_games#List_of_Games) interpreter.

Some of these have been done before, and none are particularly useful, but that is not really the point, is it? I will sometimes go months or years without thinking about these goals, but will invariably dig one out and be infatuated with the idea for some period of time, solve some new aspect of the puzzle (sometimes only in my head), and probably file it back into my imagination. I don't think actually finishing them is my primary goal necessarily, but they certainly make me happy to think about.
